## Inspiration
Although there is plentiful information available about any particular recipe, sometimes choosing the recipe is the hardest part, especially on a limited budget.
## What it does
It shows the user a weekly plan of meals based on a given budget input. The user may decide whether or not to include breakfast, lunch and/or dinner.
## How I built it
We spent a while brainstorming and learning React, and then all worked on different components and implementation details.
## Challenges I ran into
We had to learn React, as well as attempt to use an api for recipes called Spoonacular. Unfortunately, we ran out of time, so the front-end gui does not display data from the Spoonacular api.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I helped push the planning forward and kept the team on track with the requirements guidelines. I researched the possible frameworks and apis
## What I learned
I learned the general strategies for developing a gui and planning out a web application
## What's next for StruggleMeals
We want to finish integrating the api and the gui, as well as host it on Heroku or Google Cloud with a domain from Domain.com
